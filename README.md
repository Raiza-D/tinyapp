## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cookie-session


## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

## Side Notes
- `cookie-parser` is NOT needed as a Dependency. Purposely left it installed as a package and listed in my `package.json` file for project evaluation purposes only during my time at Lighthouse Labs. This package was required at the starting stages of the project's development, but was then replaced with `cookie-session`.
